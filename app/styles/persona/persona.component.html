            <blockquote>
                “Following a structure similar to a user persona, you can
                <strong>flesh out your design’s personality</strong> by creating a design persona. Personality can
                manifest
                itself in an interface <strong>through visual design, copy, and interactions.</strong> A design persona
                describes how to channel personality in each of these areas and helps the web team to construct a
                <strong>unified and consistent result.</strong>”
                <br />

                The Design Persona is used to create and design a product that engages users emotionally in order to
                create a
                positive and memorable experience. This document serves as a framework for making product and design
                decisions,
                ensuring that every decision made creates a unified and consistent experience in NaviPlan.

            </header>
            <h4>Voice Overview</h4>
            <p>
                NaviPlan is incredibly knowledgeable and confident, yet it does not feel the need to prove this. It does
                not
                rely on verbose formality to convey its knowledge, rather, efficiency and clarity are valued over
                excessively
                academic vocabulary. NaviPlan understands different users are at different levels of understanding and
                will
                tailor its language accordingly to fulfill the ultimate goal of helping people better understand the
                world.
                NaviPlan uses a scientific and precise feel, manifesting from the navigational theme found in imagery,
                differentiating itself from competitors. It never veers into an overly clever territory, instead,
                NaviPlan is
                focused on engaging users in conversation and resolving problems to promote an emotional connection.
            </p>

            <h4>Copy Examples</h4>
            <strong>When guiding newer or less knowledgeable</strong>
            <p>NaviPlan uses clear, plain-English explanations and instructions.</p>
            <blockquote>
                "More information is needed before a report can be generated. Fill out your client's information and try
                again."
                <br /><br />
                "You need to enter an income before continuing."
                <br /><br />
                "The description field contains invalid characters. Only use alphanumeric (A-Z, a-z, 1-9) characters in
                the
                description field."
            </blockquote>

            <strong>When working with more experienced users or complex topics</strong>
            <p>NaviPlan is efficient but rigorously precise with explanations and wording.</p>
            <blockquote>
                "Holdings are investment products, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. These can be used to fund a
                client's
                goals."
            </blockquote>

            <strong>When things are going well</strong>
            <p>NaviPlan is not afraid to let you know and congratulate you, but it will not dwell on it.</p>
            <blockquote>
                "Your report has been successfully generated." <br /><br />
                "Client's information has been updated. Continue?"
            </blockquote>

            <strong>When something goes wrong</strong>
            <p>NaviPlan immediately lets you know that there is a problem, where it is, and how to fix it.</p>
            <blockquote>
                "The error in this field must be fixed before proceeding." <br /><br />
                "We need more information about your client before we can generate insights. Try adding your clients’
                incomes."
                <br /><br />
                "Continue and remove transfer records? This account is associated with one or more transfer records.

            </header>
            <h4>Colors</h4>
            <p>
                NaviPlan’s color palette uses more neutral colors with instances of bright colors to convey a sense of
                professionalism, yet remain inviting and fun for the user. In NaviPlan, there is consistent use of gold
                and
                purple colors to emphasize structure. The purpose of these colors is to enable a smooth, intuitive flow
                through
                the application.

                <figcaption>
                    Purple is used to guide you to different action elements, such as buttons and checkboxes. The more
                    vibrant the
                    element, the more likely that it is something useful to the task at hand.

                    Gold will always be used to highlight elements that help you understand where you are. This is found
                    in top
                    and side navigation bars as well as on the tabs within a given page.

            <h4>Typography</h4>
            <p>
                NaviPlan is powerful, clear, and efficient, and its typography reflects it. Simple, sans-serif headings
                and a
                body copy appropriately varied in scale and weight communicate information hierarchy. The dark grey
                color and
                clean lines of Nunito Sans make NaviPlan feel like a trusted analytical tool that is both functional and
                easy to
                use.
            </p>
            <img src="../../../assets/persona/Type_Light.png" />

            <h4>Illustration</h4>
            <p>
                NaviPlan uses elements that are flat and simple, keeping the tool easy to understand, clean, and not
                intimidating. Illustrations use lines and light color fills to complete a space without making it feel
                busy and
                unclear. Purple should be the main color used in the lines and fills of illustrations, gold can be
                brought in
                when elements are large enough or in an area that calls for more detail. NaviPlan uses illustrations
                sparingly
                and only in areas that can afford an added element, such as empty states or modal selections.
            </p>
            <div class="ill-container">
                <p><strong>These illustration guidelines should be followed:</strong></p>
                <img src="../../../assets/persona/illustrations.jpg" />
            </div>

            <h4>Shadows/Elevation</h4>
            <p>
                NaviPlan uses shadows and elevation in elements that overlap other elements on a page
                when opened, expanded, hovered, etc. Shadows are light and have a high blur, this allows
                the shadow to elevate the element without making it too distinguished or distracting to
                the user. This shadow guideline should be followed: -2px y-axis, 0px x-axis, 10px blur,
                2px spread, and (0,0,0,6) color. NaviPlan uses shadows and elevation sparingly and only
                in areas such as dropdown, tooltips, side panels, list buttons, datepickers, and snackbars.

                <h3>How does NaviPlan interact with users?</h3>
            </header>
            <h4>Surprise & Delight</h4>
            <p>
                NaviPlan changes the aerial photography images on login screens each release for both the NaviPlan
                financial
                planning tool and the NaviPlan Administration tool.
            </p>
            <img src="../../../assets/persona/engage.jpg" />
            <p>
                NaviPlan uses micro-interactions on elements to entice the user to continue working through the tool.
                These
                micro-interactions are slight but enough to be noticeable, interesting, and unexpected to the user.
            </p>

            <h4>Anticipation</h4>
            <p>
                NaviPlan uses Pendo to add Coming Soon and What’s New popups into the tool, allowing the user to
                anticipate and
                understand new features, calculations, or design elements.
            </p>
            <img src="../../../assets/persona/anticipate.jpg" />
            <h4>Velvet Rope & Status</h4>
            <p>
                NaviPlan uses Beta or User Testing on chosen user groups for new features, calculations, or design
                elements.
                This limited access to new product elements helps elicit a feeling of exclusivity, allowing the user to
                anticipate and feel an elevated perceived status.
